# hello-world
Holy moly what am I doing? Trying to learn how to use Git, I guess. Carry on, there is nothing for you here!
I'm attempting to learn all this git biz for data sciencing purposes.
Particularly, I'm hoping I might find neat ways to use it for materials conservation and heritage preservation.
E.g. for analysis of environmental and survey data.
